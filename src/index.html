        <h2 class="content-head content-head-ribbon">Why PWA compared to Native Apps?</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>It supports reusability of code across different platforms i.e., Html, JavaScript and CSS</li>
          <li>Learn one language and apply everywhere i.e, JavaScript</li>
          <li>It is written in JavaScript - a well known language with largest ecosystem and community</li>
          <li>It can be integrated into an existing website and enhance user experience in modern browser that supports
            PWA. So, existing customers can directly benefit from it.</li>
          <li>It can benefit from the site's popularity.</li>
          <li>Reduces installation friction</li>
          <li>Updates to PWA is immediately delivered to customers.</li>
          <li>Smaller file downloads during incremental updates</li>
          <li>Supports sharing application through URL</li>
          <li>PWA coupled with AMP(Accelerated Mobile Pages) provides faster initial load and smooth, cached subsequents
            requests.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="content-head is-center">Feature 1: Cache content for Offline access</h2>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
          <p>
            Service worker script can be enabled for entire domain. If added to the site root, it gets activated on page
            load and starts caching the site assets and request originating for entire domain in the userâ€™s browser
            cache/storage based on configured routes. Once cached, next time application can load instantly even
            work without network.
          </p>
          <p>Typical storage quota for PWA is 50MB, above which app might show warning depending on the browser. If
            required, we can minimize storage usage by caching particular site paths or assets.</p>
          <h3>Demo :</h3>
          <p>This website caches all assets like html, scripts, css and external fonts using cache storage. So even when
            network connection is weak or offline, site page loads instantly without showing offline page.</p>

    <div class="content ribbon">
      <h2 class="content-head is-center content-head-ribbon">Feature 2: Notification API for alerts</h2>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
          <p>
            Sometimes we allow users to generate heavy reports and alerts. These tasks usually take long duration to
            complete, and during that period the users can be easily distracted & navigate away from the site. So, using
            Notification API we can immediately notify the user using device notification system and provide him with a
            clickable notification that brings him back to the report page.</p>
          <p> Since this messages are shown using device notification system, we can reach the user even if he is on
            another browser tab or even another application.
          </p>
          <p>For this API to work, we need user permission to access Notifications API and use it. Based on the feature
            supported by the device from different vendor, we can send either a simple notification messages or rich
            text
            with images as content.</p>
          <h3 class="content-head-ribbon">Demo :</h3>
          <button type="button" id="initiate-notify-demo" class="pure-button">Initiate Demo</button>&nbsp;
          <button type="button" id="notify-alert-demo" class="pure-button">Display an Alert</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2 class="content-head is-center">Feature 3: Improve user engagement using Push API</h2>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
          When new article/news posts are available on website, we can directly send the message to the user device
          using Push API to notify/promote it through device notifications. These messages can be received on the user
          device, even when the browser is not open/running. </p>
          <p>This proactive way of alerting user help to re-engage the interested user & bringing in traffic, who may be
            busy with other works or may have forgotten to visit site lately.</p>
          <h3 class="content-head-ribbon">Demo :</h3>
          <button type="button" id="initiate-push-demo" class="pure-button">Initiate Demo (Check Notification
            permission)</button>&nbsp;
          <button type="button" id="push-alert-demo" class="pure-button">Display a push message</button>
          <br />
          <textarea name="push-channel-detail" id="push-channel-detail"></textarea>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content ribbon">
      <h2 class="content-head is-center content-head-ribbon">Feature 4: Perform CPU intensive operations using Service
        Worker</h2>
      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
          This allows heavy scripts to offload its work to Service Worker (non-UI thread). So
          that, the app will still be responsive when calculation happens in parallel. Web frameworks like Angular 5+
          utilizes Service Worker for enhancing user experience.
