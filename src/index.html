        <h2 class="content-head content-head-ribbon">Why PWA compared to Native Apps?</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li>It supports reusability of code across different platforms i.e., Html, JavaScript and CSS</li>
          <li>Learn one language and apply everywhere i.e, JavaScript</li>
          <li>It is written in JavaScript - a well known language with largest ecosystem and community</li>
          <li>It can be integrated into an existing website and enhance user experience in modern browser that supports
            PWA. So, existing customers can directly benefit from it.</li>
          <li>It can benefit from the site's popularity.</li>
          <li>Reduces installation friction</li>
          <li>Updates to PWA is immediately delivered to customers.</li>
          <li>Smaller file downloads during incremental updates</li>
          <li>Supports sharing application through URL</li>
          <li>PWA coupled with AMP(Accelerated Mobile Pages) provides faster initial load and smooth, cached subsequents
            requests.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            Service worker script can be enabled for entire domain. If added to the site root, it gets activated on page
            load and starts caching the site assets and request originating for entire domain in the userâ€™s browser
            cache/storage based on configured routes. Once cached, next time application can load instantly even
            work without network.
          </p>
          <p>Typical storage quota for PWA is 50MB, above which app might show warning depending on the browser. If
            required, we can minimize storage usage by caching particular site paths or assets.</p>
          <h3 class="content-head">Demo :</h3>
          <p>This website caches all assets like html, scripts, css and external fonts using cache storage. So even when
            network connection is weak or offline, site page loads instantly without showing offline page.</p>

      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
          <p>
            In most of our application, we allow users to generate reports from huge amount of data, these tasks usually
            take long duration to complete. During the wait time, the users usually gets distracted and navigate away
            from the site. And currently, there is no other way for users to know whether their report is ready without
            checking the site page frequently.
          </p>
          <p>Using Notification API, we can enhance the user experience by notifying the user using device notification
            system when task is completed and provide him with a clickable notification that brings him back to the
            actual report page. Since this messages are shown using notification system, we can reach the user even if
            he is on another browser tab or even another application.

          <h3 class="content-head content-head-ribbon">Few things to consider :</h3>
          <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>Notification API requires user permission to show notifications from our site. So, this cannot
              completely replace the current in-page notifictaions.</li>
            <li>Based on the device OS and browser, the level of richness in showing the notification may differ.
              Notification display in Latest Operating System supports rich text with images.</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="pure-g">
        <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
          <p>One of the best feature of native apps is its ability to re-engage user periodically by displaying relevant
            content through push notifications. Typical notification may be related to on-going discounts/promos/offers,
            latest content from a subscribed channel or news magazine or informing about goal/milestone completion etc.,
          </p>
          <p>So in-case of a news/blog post site; when a new article/news post is published on website, we
            can directly send the notifications to the user's device using Push API to notify/promote the content
            through device notifications center. These messages can be delivered to the user device, even when the
            browser is not open/running. </p>
          <p>This way of alerting helps to re-engage with the interested user or targetted audience, and there by
            bringing in more traffic and returning/loyal visitors to the website.</p>
